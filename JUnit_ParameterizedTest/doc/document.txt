Parameterized tests:

The custom runner Parameterized implements parameterized tests.
When running a parameterized test class, instances are created for the cross-product of 
the test methods and the test data elements.

The number of elements in each array provided by the method annotated with @Parameters 
must correspond to the number of parameters in the constructor of the class. 
The class is created for each parameter and the test values are passed via the constructor to the class.
