/***** @Entity, @Id *****/
@Entity declares the class as an entity (i.e. a persistent POJO class), @Id declares the identifier property of this entity.


/***** PrimaryKeyJoinColumn *****/
The @PrimaryKeyJoinColumn and @PrimaryKeyJoinColumns annotations define the primary key(s) of the joined subclass table:


/***** FetchType *****/
FetchType.LAZY = Doesn’t load the relationships unless explicitly “asked for” via getter
FetchType.EAGER = Loads ALL relationships


/***** MappedBy *****/
Using "mappedBy" attribute of mapping annotations(like @OneToOne, @OneToMany, @ManyToMany) for bi-directional relationship. 
This attribute allows you to refer the associated entities from both sides. If "X" has association with "Y" then you can get X from Y and Y from X.

For example, If you have "Book" entity and "Author" entity those are associated to each other in the way that Book has a Author and Author associated with a Book.
Now if you retrieve the Book Object from hibernate session, then you can get the Author entity from Book entity. 
Or if you get the Author entity then you can get the Book entity from Author entity.
So you require the bidirectional navigation relationships between Book and Author entities. 

This is achieved in the Hibernate using the  @OneToOne relationship provided that child entity must have property type of parent and 
marked with annotation @OneToOne(mappedBy="parent") where parent is the Owner entity of this child entity.


/***** Cascade Types *****/
The cascade types supported by the Java Persistence Architecture are as below:

CascadeType.PERSIST : means that save() or persist() operations cascade to related entities.
CascadeType.MERGE : means that related entities are merged into managed state when the owning entity is merged.
CascadeType.REFRESH : does the same thing for the refresh() operation.
CascadeType.REMOVE : removes all related entities association with this setting when the owning entity is deleted.
CascadeType.DETACH : detaches all related entities if a “manual detach” occurs.
CascadeType.ALL : is shorthand for all of the above cascade operations.
