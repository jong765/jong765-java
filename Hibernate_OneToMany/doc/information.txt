/***** @Temporal *****/
In plain Java APIs, the temporal precision of time is not defined. 
When dealing with temporal data you might want to describe the expected precision in database. 
Temporal data can have DATE, TIME, or TIMESTAMP precision (ie the actual date, only the time, or both). 
Use the @Temporal annotation to fine tune that.
